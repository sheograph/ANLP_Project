# Neural Detection of AI-Generated Text

## Preparatory Stage (31.10 - 7.11)
- Defining the project's goals and objectives in the context of AI-generated text detection.
- Choosing the specific document theme and deciding on the language for analysis.
- Team role distribution.
- Developing a strategy for data collection and preparation for model training.
- Creating a database for data storage.

## Data Collection (7.11 - 14.11)
- Completing the database creation.
- Uploading documents to the database.

## Data Preparation and Model Architecture Selection (14.11 - 21.11)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Tokenization of data.
- Choosing the model architecture for AI-generated text detection.

## Model Training (21.11 - 5.12)
- Finalizing work with data.
- Initializing and configuring the model for training.
- Initial model training on a small dataset.
- Scaling the model and data (augmenting the dataset) to improve detection quality.
- Model architecture fine-tuning based on results.

## Final Stages (5.12 - 19.12)
- Model training and fine-tuning.
- Documenting the project, including architecture description, hyperparameters, and data sources.
- Final testing and debugging of the model.
- Preparing a presentation and speech text.
